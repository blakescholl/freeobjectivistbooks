      Owing to a problem with Amazon Payments, we can't accept payment via credit card right now.
      I'm working to fix this and hope to have it resolved by Friday, July 5.
    </p>
    <p class="detail">
      In the meantime, a workaround is as follows:
    </p>
    <ol class="detail">
      <li>
        Go to Amazon and buy a gift certificate for <%= humanized_money_with_symbol amazon_payment.amount %>:
        <%= link_to 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LLIKVU', 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LLIKVU' %>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Put your name on it so we know who it's from.</strong></li>
      <li>Send it to: donations@freeobjectivistbooks.org</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="detail">
      If you have any problems, contact Jason: <%= mail_to 'jason@rationalegoist.com' %>

<p>Recently you got a thank-you message from <%= @event.user %> for <i><%= @event.book %>,</i> but you couldn't reply to it. (If you hit "reply" on the email, it went to me, Jason, instead.)</p>

<p>Now you can reply to <%= @event.user %> if you want:</p>

<p><strong><%= link_to "Reply to #{@event.user}", new_donation_message_url(@event.donation, reply_to_event_id: @event.id) %></strong></p>

<p>As a reminder, the thank-you message was:</p>

<p>"<%= format_block @event.message %>"</p>

<p>Also, you can now send a message to any student you've donated to at any time through the Free Objectivist Books site. Just go to the request detail page for that student and you'll see "Send a message".</p>

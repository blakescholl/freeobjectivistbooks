Recently you got a thank-you message from <%= @event.user %> for <%= @event.book %>, but you couldn't reply to it. (If you hit "reply" on the email, it went to me, Jason, instead.)

Now you can reply to <%= @event.user %> if you want:
<%= new_donation_message_url @event.donation, reply_to_event_id: @event.id %>

As a reminder, the thank-you message was:

"<%= @event.message %>"

Also, you can now send a message to any student you've donated to at any time through the Free Objectivist Books site. Just go to the request detail page for that student and you'll see "Send a message".

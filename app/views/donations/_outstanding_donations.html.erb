        <strong>You can always send the book yourself,</strong> directly to the student. Use this
        button to see shipping info for each book. You can often get better prices on books this
        way, especially if you buy them used. Or, if you have extra copies at home, use this option
        and simply drop them in the mail.

          If ordering online to ship directly to the student, you may need to put in a phone number.
          We don't collect student's phone numbers right now; it's best to enter your own number.

<p>You requested a copy of <i><%= @event.book %></i> from Free Objectivist Books
  on <%= short_date_with_time_ago @event.request.created_at %>. I'm sorry we haven't found a donor for you yetâ€”we get a
  lot of requests for books, and sometimes we can't get enough donations to grant them all. (We try to find a donor for
  every request, but no guarantees.)
</p>

<p>We've canceled your request for now, since we're not sure if you still want the book or if we still have the right
  address for you. However, if you still want the book, you are welcome to reopen your request using this link:
</p>

<p><b><%= link_to renew_request_url(@event.request) do %>Reopen your request for <i><%= @event.book %></i><% end %></b>
</p>

Or, if you'd like to place a brand new request, use this link:

<p><%= link_to "Make a new book request", new_request_url %></p>

<p>Be sure to write a clear and compelling statement of why you want the book, to motivate a donor to choose you.</p>

<% if @mention_donor_drive %>
<p>By the way, we'll be launching a new program soon and a new donor drive that I expect to bring a lot more donations.
  So if may be worth reopening your request, even if it's been open for a long time.
</p>

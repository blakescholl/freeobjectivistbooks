You requested a copy of <%= @event.book %> from Free Objectivist Books on <%= short_date_with_time_ago @event.request.created_at %>. I'm sorry we haven't found a donor for you yet--we get a lot of requests for books, and sometimes we can't get enough donations to grant them all. (We try to find a donor for every request, but no guarantees.)

We've canceled your request for now, since we're not sure if you still want the book or if we still have the right address for you. However, if you still want the book, you are welcome to reopen your request using this link:

<%= renew_request_url(@event.request) %>

Or, if you'd like to place a brand new request, use this link:

<%= new_request_url %>

Be sure to write a clear and compelling statement of why you want the book, to motivate a donor to choose you.

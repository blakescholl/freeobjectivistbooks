<%= @event.student.name %> says they have not yet received <%= @event.book %>, which you agreed to donate to them on <%= l @event.donation.created_at.to_date, format: :short %> (<%= distance_of_time_in_words_to_now @event.donation.created_at %> ago). Since you have not confirmed with us that you sent the book, we have canceled this request to let the student find another donor.

When you choose students to donate to, please send the books promptly, and confirm that you have sent them using the buttons on the Free Objectivist Books website.

If this is in error, please reply to this email to let us know.

            <p class="text">I have been an avid Rand enthusiast, ever since I read Atlas Shrugged at the age of
                fifteen. It changed my life, and since then, I've pushed myself as never before. ... I am incredibly
                excited to read this book, further my understanding of a wonderful philosophy, and better know myself
                in the process. Thank you, again, for making that possible for me.

            <p class="text">I can't describe how great I think it is what you do&mdash;giving away Objectivist books
                so that people will get to know (more of) Objectivism. ... When I see people like you, doing such
                things, it kind of gives me hope for my future&mdash;hope more like motivation, based on the few great
                things people have done for me. I don't think I can thank you enough in an email but, I believe, you
                have your selfish benefit from this giveaway, too. So Thank You!

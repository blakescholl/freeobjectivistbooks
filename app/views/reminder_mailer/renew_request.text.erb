You requested a copy of <%= @request.book %> from Free Objectivist Books on <%= short_date_with_time_ago @request.created_at %>. We're sorry we haven't found a donor for you yetâ€”we get a lot of requests for books, and sometimes we can't get enough donations to grant them all. (We try to find a donor for every request, but no guarantees.)

If you still want this book, please let us know using this link, and we'll put your request back at the top to find a donor:

<%= renew_request_url(@request) %>

If you don't want this book anymore, you can cancel your request instead:
<%= cancel_request_url(@request) %>

(If we don't hear back from you <% if @use_autocancel_at %>by <%= l @request.autocancel_at.to_date, format: :short %><% else %>soon<% end %>, we'll assume you're no longer interested and cancel your request automatically.)

<% if @mention_donor_drive %>
By the way, we'll be launching a new program soon and a new donor drive that I expect to bring a lot more donations. So if may be worth renewing your request, even if it's been open for a long time.
<% end %>
